# E-commerce Marketing Analytics Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard that transforms raw e-commerce business and marketing data into actionable insights for decision-makers.

### My Solution Approach
1. **Join & aggregate** datasets by date for unified view
2. **Derive meaningful metrics** from raw data columns
3. **Focus on business impact** rather than technical metrics
4. **Provide tactical recommendations** based on data patterns
